%It was found that
%Hoop length of the cylinder (circumferential, angular direction, or theta) can be expressed by
%L0 = 2*pi*R, 
%thus 
%DeltaL = {change in perimeter} = 2*pi*DeltaR .
%New radius is then
%R_new = R + DeltaR
%The bigger radius, the smaller the wall shear stress. So you have a DeltaTau, which would be the error. 

%Initial radius
r=0.012
%Initial length (Hoop length)
lo=2*pi*r

%Change in radius (Doubles to 0.024 so change is 0.012)
deltar=0.012
%Change in hoop length with respect to change in radius
deltal=2*pi*deltar

%Initial minus final gives change, so 0.012-0.024=0.012
deltar=0.012
renew=r+deltar


deltatau=-2*u*vm*y/rnew^2
deltatau=-2*0.004*0.1*0.006/rnew^2
